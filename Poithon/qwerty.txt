AdeptiCon 2022 returns with an impressive slate of events, tournaments, seminars, and classes. 
To give you a preview of what to expect, we’ve put together this sneak peak at some of the dozens of offerings taking place next year. 
From the venerable Warhammer 40,000 tournaments to the newly expanded Warhammer Age of Sigmar Team event, this year’s collection heralds a glorious return. 
There are hobby seminars by some of the today’s top artists and a wide range of historical games and tournaments, from Bolt Action to Flames of War. 
From the cyberpunk action of Infinity to the post-apocalyptic mayhem of Gaslands, there is something for every hobbyist.

This list is bound to expand, and we have several games and systems to add, like Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team, Marvel Crisis Protocol, Star Wars: Legion, X-Wing, Armada and Steve Jackson’s Car Wars, but we wanted to let you start planning your weekend. 
Additions and modifications to this list can happen right up until registration goes live so keep in mind that events are subject to change up to January 11th, 2022 at 7:00 PM Central. 
Expect to see more detailed rules and FAQs for some events over the next few weeks as organizers put the finishing touches on their games.
